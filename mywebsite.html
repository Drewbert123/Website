This is my Info 102 class website, where I will be
keeping a compilation of almost all the works I do in class.

<title> About me </title>
<p>
Hey, I'm Drew Scott! I'm currently a student at the University of Washington. This website is meant to act as a portfolio or  culmination of my work in the Informatics 101 class.
I plan to graduate with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering in Fall of 2018. After that I hope to build really cool technology, if I could work on circuit boards for
tanks that would be ideal. Some of my current hobbies include artisan crafts such as metalworking and woodworking. I also really enjoy rock climbing, hiking, pretty much anything outdoors!
Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed it!
