I'm currently a student at the University of Washington. This website is meant to act as a portfolio or  culmination of my work in the Informatics 101 class.\r\nI plan to graduate with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering in Fall of 2018. After that I hope to build really cool technology, if I could work on circuit boards for\r\ntanks that would be ideal. Some of my current hobbies include artisan crafts such as metalworking and woodworking. I also really enjoy rock climbing, hiking, pretty much anything outdoors!\r\nThanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed it!\r\n</p>\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n\r\n<body><p><i>Currently I am not only working on getting the website up and running but also working on my group and I's project, which is to build an Emergency Response App into phones so that the process of coming to a person in need of help can be facilitated more efficiently.</i><p></body>\r\n\r\n",
